% -- FIGURES AND TABLES
%
% Please include tables/figure captions directly after the paragraph where they are first cited in the text.
%
% DO NOT INCLUDE GRAPHICS IN YOUR MANUSCRIPT
% - Figures should be uploaded separately from your manuscript file.
% - Figures generated using LaTeX should be extracted and removed from the PDF before submission.
% - Figures containing multiple panels/subfigures must be combined into one image file before submission.
% For figure citations, please use "Fig" instead of "Figure".
% See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/figures for PLOS figure guidelines.
%
% Tables should be cell-based and may not contain:
% - spacing/line breaks within cells to alter layout or alignment
% - do not nest tabular environments (no tabular environments within tabular environments)
% - no graphics or colored text (cell background color/shading OK)
% See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/tables for table guidelines.
%
% For tables that exceed the width of the text column, use the adjustwidth environment as illustrated in the example table in text below.

%
% IMPORTANT
% Below are a few tips to help format your equations and other special characters according to our specifications. For more tips to help reduce the possibility of formatting errors during conversion, please see our LaTeX guidelines at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex
%
% For inline equations, please be sure to include all portions of an equation in the math environment.  For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; this should be formatted as $x^2$ (or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
%
% Do not include text that is not math in the math environment. For example, CO2 should be written as CO\textsubscript{2} instead of CO$_2$.
%
% Please add line breaks to long display equations when possible in order to fit size of the column.
%
% For inline equations, please do not include punctuation (commas, etc) within the math environment unless this is part of the equation.
%
% When adding superscript or subscripts outside of brackets/braces, please group using {}.  For example, change "[U(D,E,\gamma)]^2" to "{[U(D,E,\gamma)]}^2".
%
% Do not use \cal for caligraphic font.  Instead, use \mathcal{}

\subsection*{Spectroscopy modeling}

\subsubsection*{Model building and evaluation}

In PLS regression, there is a single tuning parameter called the number of
component (ncomp) or latent variables. This model parameter cannot be
directly estimated from the data because there is no analytical formula to
calculate it. The choice of ncomp in the final model determines the model
complexity and how adaptive the final PLS regression model for a soil property
is to the training spectra. Along with many other modern predictive modeling
techniques, PLS regression potentially bears the risk to over-fit the
structure in predictor data (spectra) in relation to the response (soil
property) to predict, particularly in cases with low number of observations and
high number of predictions. Hence in over-fitting situations, due to each
sample‚Äôs unique noise learned besides general patterns during training, the
model does not generalize well to new samples to predict. Model tuning aims
to find model parameter values that yield best and realistic prediction
accuracy. The below described model building approach embraces both model
tuning and evaluation and thereby avoids over-fitting.

% Todo: cite caret package and add PLSR package; see MSc thesis
Calibration models were fitted using the orthogonal scores PLS regression
algorithm (PLS1, single soil property response vector to predict), which is
implemented in the pls \cite{mevik_pls:_2016} R package, as described by
\cite{martens_multivariate_1989}). Based on the caret (classification and
regression training \cite{wing_caret:_2017}) and the pls R packages, a set of
PLS regression candidatate models were built using the cross-validation
resampling method. In particular, 5 times repeated 10-fold cross-validation was
chosen to determine ncomp in the final models and to estimate model performance.
Repeated K-fold cross-validation procedures provide unbiased and precise
internal estimates of predictive performance, targeting both most efficient use
of the available data set and realistic model evaluation measures
\cite{molinaro_prediction_2005}, \cite{kim_estimating_2009}. For each soil
property, ncomp for final PLS regression (PLS1) model was tuned separately. For
each soil property model, the sample set was repeatedly randomly split into $k =
10$ (approximately) equally-sized subsets without replacement for all repeats $r =
1, 2, .., 5$ and all candidate values in the tuning grid $ncomp = 1, 2, ...,
10$. Within each of the $r \times \mathrm{ncomp} = 5 \times 10 = 50$ resampling
data set splits, each of the 10 possible held-out and model fitting set
combinations (folds) was subjected to candidate model building at the respective
ncomp, using $k - 1 = 9$ out of 10 subsets and remaining held-out samples were
predicted based on the fitted models. The root mean square (RMSE, \ref{eq:RMSE})
of the held-out samples was calculated by aggregating all repeated \emph{K}-fold
cross-validation predictions ($\hat{y}_i$) and corresponding observed values
($y_i$) grouped by ncomp, which resulted in a cross-validated performance
profile RMSE vs. ncomp.

% todo: add subscript rcv (repeated K-fold cv) and adapt indices;
% look up possible mathematical expression in
% <Elements of statistical learning
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RMSE}
\textsc{rmse} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}{n}}
\end{equation}

 Based on this performance profiles, minimal ncomp among the models whose
 performance was within a single standard error (``One standard error'' rule,
 \cite{breiman_classification_1984}) of the lowest numerical value of RMSE was
 selected as final ncomp for the respective soil properties.

Model evaluation at the finally chosen ncomp was conducted based on repeated
\emph{K}-fold cross-validation estimates of the measures RMSE, $R^2$ and ratio
of performance to deviation (RPD). The RPD index is the ratio of the chemical
reference data standard deviation to the RMSE of prediction and is a scaled
index to compare goodness-of-fit across data sets with difference ranges or
variances in observed values. Besides calculating the above listed performance
measures, accuracy (bias) and precision (variance) of resampling-based held-out
predictions was expressed and depicted on an individual soil sample basis.
Particularly, sample-specific prediction means and \SI{95}{\%} confidence
intervals across cross-validation repeats (Eq. \ref{eq:pred_var} and
\ref{eq:pred_ci}; $n = r = 5$) were compared against observed values in order to
detect eventual model instabilities and trends in uncertainty patterns among
sample predictions, and finally prove the appropriateness of the chosen
resampling technique and settings for this data set.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:pred_var}
S_n^2 &= \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum{{(y_i - \overline{\hat{y_i}})}^2} \\
\label{eq:pred_ci}
\overline{\hat{y_i}} &\pm t(n - 1, 1 - \alpha / 2) \frac{S_n}{\sqrt{n}};
\alpha = 0.05
\end{align}

In order to cover the full training data space in the models for future sample
predictions, the final PLS1 regression models were rebuilt using the entire
training set and the respective values of optimal final ncomp determined by the
procedure described above.
